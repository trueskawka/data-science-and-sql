# Intro to Data Science and SQL

## Getting started

The easiest way to use this repository is by using Binder. It creates an environment to run a 
Jupyter notebook without any local setup needed: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/trueskawka/data-science-and-sql/HEAD)

If you're a begineer, using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or 
[DataCamp Workspace](https://www.datacamp.com/workspace) is going to save you a lot of pain and let you 
focus on learning exploring data and learning, instead of debugging your environment.

## Installing locally

**Note:** These are just pointers if you're really determined to install locally. I will not have time 
during the workshop to help you with your local setup. Proceed with caution :)

Most instructions will recommend using Anaconda, Conda, or Miniconda. This [Codecademy tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/article/setting-up-jupyter-notebook) is pretty good.

Since I don't like to install heavy tooling for simple purposes, I followed steps similar to [this tutorial](https://anshbadaya.medium.com/install-jupyter-notebook-without-anaconda-and-have-an-icon-to-run-it-in-your-desired-directory-3e0130ade7a6) instead.
